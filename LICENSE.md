# License

The project has two types of licenses: open-source and commercial. In general, the project is free for non-commercial, trial and educational use, and paid for commercial use.

## Open source license

The open source license can be used to create open source, trial and personal projects. The project uses the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) open source license. 

Please note that releasing your application that uses this project under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license, in turn, requires your application to be licensed under the GPLv3 license.

## Commercial license

The commercial license should be used to create commercial products and applications, without the provisions of the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license. With the commercial license, your code is kept proprietary, to yourself. If you want to use this project to develop commercial websites, themes, projects, and applications, the commercial license is the way to go.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. This License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the project (**Item**). Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.

2. You are licensed to use the Item to create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product may be Sold.

3. An End Product is one of the following things, both requiring an application of skill and effort.

    * For an Item that is a template, the End Product is a customised implementation of the Item.

      For example, the item is a magazine template and the end product is the finished magazine.

    * For other types of Item, an End Product is something that incorporates the Item as well as other things, so that it is larger in scope and different in nature than the Item.

### Things you can do with the Item

4. You can create the End Product for a client, and this license is then transferred from you to your client.

5. You can Sell and make any number of copies of the single End Product.

6. You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 3.


### Things you can’t do with the Item

7. This license is a “single application” license and not a “multi-use” license, which means that you can’t use the Item to create more than one unique End Product.

8. You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications.

9. You can’t use the Item in any application allowing an end user to customise a digital or physical product to their specific needs, such as an “on demand”, “made to order” or “build it yourself” application. You can use the Item in this way only if you purchase a separate license for each final product incorporating the Item that is created using the application. Examples of “on demand”, “made to order” or “build it yourself” applications: website builders, “create your own” slideshow apps, and e-card generators. You will need one license for each product created by a customer.

10. Although you can modify the Item and therefore delete components before creating your single End Product, you can’t extract and use a single component of an Item on a stand-alone basis. For example: You license a game starter kit. You can delete unwanted 3D models from the file. But you can’t extract and use a 3D model outside of the game starter kit.

11. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it separately from the End Product.

12. You can’t use an Item in a logo, trademark, or service mark.

### Ownership

13. MZSoft reserves ownership of all intellectual property rights inherent in or relating to the Item and corresponding source code, which include all copyright, patent rights, all rights in relation to registered and unregistered trademarks (including service marks), confidential information (including trade secrets and know-how) and all rights other than those expressly granted by this Agreement.

### Termination

14. This Agreement and the license granted hereunder shall continue until terminated in accordance with this Section. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the license shall last as long as Your use of the Item is in compliance with the terms herein.

15. MZSoft shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and the license granted hereunder immediately if You breach any of the material terms of this Agreement, and You fail to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from MZSoft. Upon termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted to You in this Agreement shall terminate automatically, and You shall immediately cease use and distribution of the Item.

16. Upon termination of this Agreement, You must cease all use of the Item. If, prior to your breach of this Agreement, you delivered Applications incorporating the Item to Your End Users, those End Users’ licenses shall survive termination.

### Disclaimer of Warranties

17. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MZSoft DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE "ITEM". WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE OPERATION OF THE "ITEM" OR YOUR APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS NOT TECHNICALLY PRACTICABLE FOR US TO DO SO.

### Limitation of Liabilities

18. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MZSoft BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LAW) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE "ITEM" OR THE CODE IT PRODUCES OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT MATTER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF MZSoft HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, MZSoft’S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE LICENSE.

### Indemnification

19. While redistributing the Item or Modifications thereof as part of Your Application, You may choose to offer acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, and not on MZSoft’s behalf.

20. You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend MZSoft and its owners, officers, agents, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, lawsuits and proceedings (collectively “Claims”), and all expenses, costs (including attorney's fees), judgments, damages and other liabilities resulting from such Claims, that arise or result from: (i) Your use of the Item in violation of this Agreement; (ii) the use or distribution of Your Application, except to the extent such claim is based solely on the inclusion of the Item therein; (iii) Your Modification of the Item’s source code; or (iv) Your accepting support, warranty, indemnity, or additional liability.


### Payment and Taxes

21. All payments under this Agreement are due to MZSoft upon Your purchase of a license to the Item.

22. Each party shall be responsible for all taxes (including, but not limited to, taxes based upon its income) or levies imposed on it under applicable laws, regulations and tax treaties as a result of this Agreement and any payments made hereunder (including those required to be withheld or deducted from payments); provided that You shall be responsible for any value added tax, use tax, sales tax, or similar tax, and shall pay or reimburse MZSoft for the same upon invoice. Each party shall furnish evidence of such paid taxes as is sufficient to enable the other party to obtain any credits available to it, including original tax withholding certificates.

### Other license terms

23. You can only use the Item for lawful purposes. Also, if an Item contains an image of a person, even if the Item is model-released you can’t use it in a way that creates a fake identity, implies personal endorsement of a product by the person, or in a way that is defamatory, obscene or demeaning, or in connection with sensitive subjects.

24. Items that contain digital versions of real products, trademarks or other intellectual property owned by others have not been property released. These Items are licensed on the basis of editorial use only. It is your responsibility to consider whether your use of these Items requires a clearance and if so, to obtain that clearance from the intellectual property rights owner.

25. This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

26. The author of the Item retains ownership of the Item but grants you the license on these terms.

27. **Item Updates and Upgrades.** The license granted herein applies only to the version of the Item available when purchased in connection with the terms of this Agreement, and to any updates and/or upgrades to which You may be entitled. Any previous or subsequent license granted to You for use of the Item shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the agreement entered in connection with purchase or download of that version of the Item.

28. **Compliance with Applicable Laws.** You agree that You will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the Item, including without limitation all export control laws and regulations.

29. **Entire Agreement.** The terms and conditions stated herein set forth the entire agreement of the parties and replace and supersede all other contracts, agreements, and understandings, written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof.

30. **Severability.** In the event that any portion of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, such portions shall not limit or otherwise modify or affect any other portion of this Agreement.
