If you agree, you just add a line saying:

```
Signed-off-by: Random Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
This will be done for you automatically if you use ``git commit -s``.
Reverts should also include "Signed-off-by". ``git revert -s`` does that
for you.

We assume that any contribution that's 10 lines or less does not meet
the threshold of originality and therefore copyright does not apply.
You don't need to add a "Signed-off-by" line to such small patches.
